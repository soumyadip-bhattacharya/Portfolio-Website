## sayries
-  मंज़िलें उन्हीं को मिलती हैं, जिनके सपनों में जान होती है। पंखों से कुछ नहीं होता, हौसलों से उड़ान होती है। (Destinies are met by those whose dreams have life. Wings are not enough, it is courage that lets you fly.)

- -ख़ुदी को कर बुलंद इतना कि हर तक़दीर से पहले, ख़ुदा बंदे से ख़ुद पूछे बता तेरी रज़ा क्या है। (Elevate yourself to such heights that before every destiny, God himself asks the man, "Tell me, what is your will?")

-सितारों से आगे जहाँ और भी हैं, अभी इश्क़ के इम्तिहाँ और भी हैं। (There are more worlds beyond the stars; there are still more tests of passion to come.)

हाथों की लकीरों पे मत जा ऐ ग़ालिब, नसीब उनके भी होते हैं जिनके हाथ नहीं होते। (Don't rely on the lines of your hands, Ghalib; destiny belongs even to those who have no hands.)

सफ़र में मुश्किलें आएं तो हिम्मत और बढ़ती है, कोई अगर रास्ता रोके तो जुर्रत और बढ़ती है। (When difficulties arise in a journey, courage increases. If someone blocks the path, audacity increases.)

On Effort & Perseverance
लहरों से डर कर नौका पार नहीं होती, कोशिश करने वालों की कभी हार नहीं होती। (A boat that fears the waves never crosses the sea; those who try never face defeat.)

कौन कहता है आसमां में सुराख नहीं हो सकता, एक पत्थर तो तबियत से उछालो यारों। (Who says a hole can't be made in the sky? Just throw a stone with conviction, my friends.)

गिरते हैं शहसवार ही मैदान-ए-जंग में, वो तिफ्ल क्या गिरे जो घुटनों के बल चले। (Only the horsemen fall in the battlefield; how can a child fall who only crawls on his knees?)

यही जज्बा रहा तो मुश्किलों का हल भी निकलेगा, जमीं बंजर हुई तो क्या वहीं से जल भी निकलेगा। (If this passion remains, a solution to difficulties will emerge. So what if the land is barren? Water will spring from there.)

हो के मायूस न यूं शाम से ढलते रहिए, ज़िंदगी भोर है सूरज सा निकलते रहिए। (Don't sink like the evening in despair; life is a dawn, keep rising like the sun.)

On Knowledge & Life
अच्छी किताब और अच्छे लोग, तुरंत समझ में नहीं आते, उन्हें पढ़ना पड़ता है। (Good books and good people are not understood immediately; one must study them.)

तजुर्बा एक ही है इल्म-ओ-हुनर में लेकिन, एक है रूह में और एक है फ़क़त ज़ेहन में। (Experience is the same in knowledge and skill, but one resides in the soul and the other merely in the mind.)

ज़िंदगी में कुछ बनना हो, कुछ पाना हो, तो हमेशा दिल की सुनो। (If you want to become something, to achieve something in life, then always listen to your heart.)

एक ही दिन में पढ़ न लेगा कोई, दिल की किताब को समझना पड़ता है। (No one can read it in a single day; the book of the heart must be understood.)

हर किसी के हाथ में बिक जाने को तैयार नहीं, ये मेरा दिल है तेरे शहर का अख़बार नहीं। (It is not ready to be sold into anyone's hands; this is my heart, not your city's newspaper.)

On Confidence & Self-Belief
मैं अकेला ही चला था जानिब-ए-मंज़िल मगर, लोग साथ आते गए और कारवाँ बनता गया। (I started towards the destination all alone, but people kept joining, and it became a caravan.)

कुछ तो बात है कि हस्ती मिटती नहीं हमारी, सदियों रहा है दुश्मन दौर-ए-ज़माँ हमारा। (There is something special that our existence does not perish, though the world has been our enemy for centuries.)

तूफ़ानों से आँख मिलाओ, सैलाबों पर वार करो, मल्लाहों का चक्कर छोड़ो, तैर के दरिया पार करो। (Look storms in the eye, attack the floods, forget the boatmen, swim across the river.)

अपने किरदार पे डाल के पर्दा 'इक़बाल', हर शख़्स कह रहा है ज़माना ख़राब है। (Covering their own character with a veil, 'Iqbal', every person says the world is bad.)

यकीन हो तो कोई रास्ता निकलता है, हवा की ओट भी ले कर चराग़ जलता है। (If there is belief, a way will be found; even with the help of the wind, a lamp can be lit.)

मिटा दे अपनी हस्ती को अगर कुछ मर्तबा चाहे, कि दाना ख़ाक में मिल कर गुल-ओ-गुलज़ार होता है। (Erase your own existence if you desire some status, for a seed becomes a garden only after mixing with the soil.)
